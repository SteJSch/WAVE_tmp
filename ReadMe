To compile WAVE use from this directory

make_wave.py

E.g.

Linux:
python3 python/make_wave.py

Windows:
python3 python\make_wave.py

If some files have changed the script should compile everything needed.

If bin/wave.exe is missing, everything is compiled.

To compile all source files in a directory, delete the corresponding
library in the lib directory before running the Python script.

The default compiler is gfortran. The compile command and options can
be overwritten according to the file 

config_fortran.py 

in the python directory.

Example: Replace the leading "#" to activate the variable, replace "-O2"
by "-g" to compile with debug options.

Test installation:

Linux:
cd stage
../bin/wave.exe

Windows (PowerShell or CMD.exe):
cd stage
..\bin\wave.exe
